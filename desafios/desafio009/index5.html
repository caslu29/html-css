    <p>Air Jordan is an American brand of basketball shoes, athletic, casual, and style clothing produced by Nike. Founded in Chicago, Air Jordan was created for Hall of Fame former basketball player Michael Jordan during his time with the Chicago Bulls.[2][3] The original Air Jordan sneakers were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in late 1984, and released to the public on April 1, 1985.[4][5] The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore.[6][7]. Michael Jordan and Spike Lee released the Jordan Spiz'ike shoes on October 21, 2006, as a tribute to their historic relationship.[29] The relationship began when Mars Blackmon (a character from Spike Lee's film, She's Gotta Have It) became the primary pitchman in Nike commercials for Air Jordans. The Spiz'ike is a mash-up of the Jordan III, IV, V, VI, Air Jordan IX and XX shoes. Only 4,567 pairs were made of the original release,[29] with all of the proceeds going to Morehouse College.[30] Each future release of the shoes varied the colors used.</p>
